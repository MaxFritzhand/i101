<h2> Database Questions </h2> 
<li><h3> What are the common types of problems with data? </h3> </li>
<p>Some common types of problems with data are the ones that do not match the rest. For example, the '345' in GPA when the rest of them are on a 4.0 scale, wrong data that doesn't fit the requirments. </p>

<li><h3> What was the hardest type of data problem to clean for you? </h3></li>
<p>I had trouble cleaning up the empty data at first due to syntax error. It was able to be fixed and cleaned using null. </p>
<li><h3> How comfortable do you feel about cleaning data sets? (1-5 :: 1 == highly uncomofortable, 5 == quite comfortable) </h3> </li>
<p>I'm at level 3. With more practice, I'll be more confident with what I am doing. </p>
