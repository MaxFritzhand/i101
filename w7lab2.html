<h1> JS 3 </h1>
<h2> JS Questions </h2>
<h3>What is the difference between n=1+2 and n="1" +"2"? If you were to display the contents of n, 
what would be shown on your page for each? </h3>
<ul><li> n=1+2 is an integer and would display 3. n="1"+"2" is a string and is concatenated. It
would display 12.</li></ul>
<h3>What does the += mean/do? What did we use for in our JS function?</h3>
<ul><li> x+=b is the same thing as x=x+b. It adds the variable x to the right side of the equation.	
for is a loop type and we used it to get to our maximum number (user input).</li></ul>
<h3>What two pieces of code/functions/attributes have we used the last few labs to indicate/indentify 
where our JS changes are going to happen? </h3>
<ul><li> ID for referencing later. And function 	</li></ul>


<p>Please enter a non-negative number: </p>
<input type="text" id="max_number"/>
<input type="button" onClick="count_it()" value="Count!"/>
<br>
<span id="counter"></span>

	<script>
 function count_it()
 {
 var max_num = document.getElementById("max_number").value;
 var numbers = "";
 for(var i=1; i<=max_num;i++){
		if((i%2)==0){
			numbers+=String(i)+ "<br>";
		}
		else{
		numbers += String(i) +" ";
		}
	}
	document.getElementById("counter").innerHTML=numbers; 
 }
